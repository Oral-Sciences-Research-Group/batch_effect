The Salivary Microbiome as a Diagnostic Biomarker of Periodontitis a 16S Multi-Batch Study Before and After the Removal of Batch Effects
A total of 8 files are included. Of which four are raw data obtained after the bioinformatic pipeline, and the other four files are the data obtained after removing ASVs with abundance below 0.2%. The following tables are included:
1- Clinical metadata of all samples.
2- Table of counts of all the ASVs of all the samples.
3- Taxonomy of all ASVs
4- The complete sequences of each ASV

The raw data has a total of 9859 ASVs. After filtering for minimum abundance of 0.2%, the number of ASVs is 355.
